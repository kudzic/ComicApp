First Api interaction using the xkcd api for comics
Hey there this was a educational project that l decided to do on my own it uses xkcd api and it was my first interaction with web api's and believe me when l managed to 
make my application show comics l was really happy and just showed me how intersting programming is .If you like the repository feel free to use it but as a disclamer 
I dont own any comics used they belong to xkcd so please respect their brand when you use them.If they is anything you would want to know just add me and try to contact 
me lwouldbe happy to help.
